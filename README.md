# DiscontinuityLab
DiscontinuityLab is a free solution prototype for discontinuitiy extraction and mean orientation derivation of dip / dip direction as it is done by so-called scanline analysis in geology.
It is proposed as a stand alone executable (v1.3) with the import raw files (Fa 

Refered to Caudal et al. (2020) for the methodology and the content of the raw and project files (Synthetic and Saulges outcrops). The raw files are the csv files exported with Facets (Dewez et al., 2016), a plugin of CouldCompare (Girardeau-Montaut, 2019).

An englishh version and a tutorial will be available soon.
